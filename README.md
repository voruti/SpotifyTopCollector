# SpotifyTopCollector

Collect any top/first song in playlist into another playlist.

## Obtaining configuration values

Three configuration values go into `config.json` (use `_config.json` as template):

1. `clientId` and
2. `clientSecret` can be copied from an application at <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications>. The application needs a redirect URI of `http://localhost:8888/callback`.
3. `refreshToken` can be generated by executing `node obtainRefreshToken.js`.
